## Introduction  

This package contains an implementation of EC-VRF scheme specified in the IRTF internet draft[1]. And we extends the [github.com/google/keytransparency/core/crypto/vrf/p256](https://github.com/google/keytransparency/tree/master/core/crypto/vrf/p256) package to support elliptic curves of different bitsize such as 
NIST p224 curve, SM2 p256r1 curve, and so on.
